Most of the relevant codes are stored in the 
`notebooks` and `training_scripts` directories.

`training_scripts` consists of all the python files 
whereas `notebooks` consists of all the ipython notebooks. 

The ipython notebooks were used mainly for 
inline visualizations such as data visualization,
similarity search, and evaluation.

The python files were used for training, and data cleaning tasks.
